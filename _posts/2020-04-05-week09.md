title: "Week 8: Project Picked!"

Gil Yehuda taught me a lot about open-source. Before taking this class, I had always envisioned open-source to be something that computer scientists did in their free time. My conception has obviously been disproven. First, when the VP of Open Source at Bloomberg came to speak to us I got a glimpse at how/why a huge corporation would care about open-source software and projects. Now, with Gil, I have seen that open-source can actually be an essential part of a software company! From recruiting talent to publishing open-source content to snub out a competitor, open-source has much more corporate utility than I once imagined.

I have been lagging behind recently with my contributions page, yet I hope to make more progress this week.
