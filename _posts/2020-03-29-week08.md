title: "Week 8: Project Picked!"
---

My team has picked "Gatsby JS" which is a free and open source framework based on React that helps developers build "blazing fast websites and apps". Although none of us are JS gods, we all have experience with the language and are excited to improve. 

One of the very interesting things about this project, and an aspect that is entirely new to me, is the development enviornment. For Gatsby JS, they ask their contributors to use "GitPod" which launches ready-to-code virutal development environments. For Gatsby, all you have to do is open up a GitPod enviornment with the specific issue tag that you want to work on, and it starts up a pre-built docker image with the codebase already compiled and ready for you to work on the issue. This system, although new to me, seems extremely promising. GitPod has collaboration settings, so all three of us in our group can work on the exact same virtual enviornment (they compare their collaboration mode to that of "Google Docs"). I am excited to get working on the project, and we hope to have our first issue picked and finished within the first week. After finishing that first easy issue, we hope to pick a more in-depth problem to work on.
