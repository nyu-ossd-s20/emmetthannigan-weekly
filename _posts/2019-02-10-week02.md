title: "Week 2: Extension"
---

Team 4 decided to implement a basic game of chance extension, where the user can select "flip a coin" or "roll a dice". At this moment we are finished with the dice functionality, and simply need to implement the javacript animation to the coin flip. I personally have very little Javascript experience, but have been able to contribute to both the code for the dice roll and the research needed to determine which types of animation we want to use. If everything remains on track, which at this rate seems likely, we will have a fully operational extension completed by the due date.

I personally had never built a brower extension before, so the entire experience was new to me. We have worked well as a team, and have all contributed to the project thus far.
