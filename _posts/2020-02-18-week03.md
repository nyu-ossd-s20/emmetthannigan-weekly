title: "Week 3: Extensions Finished"
---

I spoke about our teamwork when building our browser extension in my last post, so I will talk about other projects in this post. I really enjoyed two extension presentations: "table of contents" and "light switch". 

The table of contents extension was not only well built, but would be extremely useful on some poorly designed sites. As they mentioned, many times long papers (such as an implementation doc) take ages to scroll through, so using their extension it would be easy to skip to a specific section. "Light switch" was presented as a slightly comedic extension, with the smiling sun, yet would have real value in my opinion. Just like I can set my iPhone to change color schemes at night, our web browsers should do the same thing. Overall, the presentations went well and everyone seemed to enjoy the extension project.
