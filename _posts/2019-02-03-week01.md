When I hear “open source”, I think about a phenomenon called the “wisdom of the crowd”.  There will always be idiosyncratic noise associated with an individual’s contribution, but taking the average over a large number of responses will act as a buffer, canceling the effect of the noise. Famous sites like Wikipedia and Quora function on this principle, and the same can be said for many open source software projects. This principle allows a group of people to perform tasks and gain knowledge more effectively and more accurately than a single expert. Open source projects benefit from the wisdom of the crowd, but specifically concern me in regards to security. Open source software projects are not always developed in a controlled environment, and many times lack the necessary security practices and tests. I registered for this class to learn more about the pros and cons of open source projects, and am excited to contribute to a few of them. 
I frequently use both “NLTK” and “scikit-learn”. NLTK is an NLP open source project and scikit-learn is a machine learning open source project. In the past, I was heavily influenced by a previous internship where we spent almost the entire summer working in .NET Core. This was my first experience with an open source project.
