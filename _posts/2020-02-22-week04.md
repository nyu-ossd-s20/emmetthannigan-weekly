title: "Week 4: Open-Source and Data"
---

This week was obviously a short one, but I learned a lot about data. Deena, one of the speakers, teaches a database design class that I was able to take last semseter. Many of the SQL topics we discussed had been taught in depth in her class, but her ability to simplify complex topics still amazes me. If any of my fellow OSSD students happen to be reading this blog post, I highly recommend that you take Deena's database class if you thought that her discussion topics were interesting in class. It is practical, and touches on many aspects of computer science that aren't traditionally taught in our courses.

When relating the use of data for real-world projects, it was awesome to hear about Vicky's work at the museum of natural history. I had always assumed that running a museum would be complex, but had never considered how immense the role of data would play in that complexity. Vicky's mention of "awesome-public-datasets" was encouraging, and I have already checked out the repo for future data projects. 

Overall, open-data is an incredibly interesting field, and it encompasses many aspects of computer science. Big-data has always been used as a buzz-word in the industry, yet Deena and Vicky were able to introduce concrete programs and examples of how big-data can run complex systems.
